\v 1 The words of Amos,
\q2 one of the drovers\f + \fl Lit. \fqa one of the cattle-branders. \ft Amos was probably "a rider for a brand," herding animals in an economy of scale. See 7.14f.\f* from Tekoa.
\q1 These are the visions that he saw about Israel
\q2 during the term of King Uzziah of Judah,
\q1 and the term of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel,
\q2 two years before the earthquake.

\v 2 And he said, "The \nd Lord\nd* roars from Zion,
\q2 and calls out from Jerusalem.
\q1 'Hey! The sheep pastures are declining,
\rem Lit. "And the sheep pastures..."
\q2 and the top of Carmel is dying back!'”
\b
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Damascus –-
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 They've used iron tools to thresh Gilead.
\q2 \v 4 So I will set the house of Hazael on fire,
\q1 and it will burn up the high buildings of Ben-hadad.
\q2 \v 5 And I will break the gate-bar of Damascus,
\q1 and get rid of those who live in the valley of Aven,
\q2 and the one who holds the scepter in Beit Eden;
\q1 the people of Aram will be deported to Kir,"
\q2 says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Gaza ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 Because they herded together a whole people,
\q2 and sold them off as slaves to Edom.
\v 7 So I will set the wall of Gaza on fire,
\q2 and it will burn up her high buildings.
\v 8 And I will get rid of anyone who lives in Ashdod,
\q2 and of the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon.
\q1 I will turn my hand against Ekron,
\q2 and the survivors of the Philistines will die off," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 9 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Tyre ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 Because they deported an entire population to Edom,
\q2 and did not honor their treaty of friendship.
\v 10 So I will set fire to the walls of Tyre.
\q2 And it will burn up her high buildings."
\b
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Edom ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 They hunted their sister nation with the sword,
\q2 and stifled their pity,
\q1 and refused to let go of their anger,
\q2 and permanently held on to their rage.
\v 12 So I will set fire to Teman.
\q2 It will burn up the high buildings of Bozrah."
\b
\v 13 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from the nation of Ammon ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 Because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,
\q2 to be able to expand their own territory.
\v 14 So I will have fire set to the wall of Rabbah.
\q2 It will burn up her high buildings,
\q1 with a bugle call in the heat of battle,
\q2 with a charge during the assault.\f + \ft Taking the words "rush" and "storm" in their military sense.\f*
\v 15 Their king will be deported on foot,
\q2 he and his officials all together," the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\b
\c 2
\v 1 The \nd Lord\nd* says, " After three atrocities from Moab ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 Because they burned the bones
\q2 of the king of Edom to lime.
\v 2 So I will set fire to Moab.
\q2 It will burn up the high buildings of the Kerioth,
\q1 And Moab will perish in the onslaught.
\q2 With a bugle-call, with the sound of the horn.
\v 3 And I will get rid of the judges among them,
\q2 and execute all of his officials with him," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Judah ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\q1 Because they have trampled on the teaching of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and have not kept his traditions.
\q1 But their mirages have made them wander,
\q2 in the same ways their ancestors followed.
\v 5 So I will set fire to Judah.
\q2 And it will burn up the high buildings of Jerusalem."
\b
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Israel ---
\q2 make that four --- I am not suspending their sentence.
\v They buy out stable people with money,
\q2 and foreclose on those who are bankrupt.\f + \fl Lit. \fqa and the needy for a pair of shoes. \ft A land transaction is implied (Ruth 4.7, Deut. 25.9).\f*
\rem Lit. ""
\v 7 Driving the head of the weak down into the dusty ground,
\q2 and taking advantage of simple people.
\q1 A man and his father use the same girl,
\q2 Flaunting their violation of my sacred name.
\v 8 And they bed down on pawned clothing
\q2 at the foot of every altar,
\q1 and drink wine paid as fines
\q2 in the temple of their God."
\b
\v 9 Now, I was the one who wiped out the Amorites in front of you.
\q2 They were tall, as tall as cedars,
\q1 and they were sturdy as oak trees.
\q2 I cut off their fruit up above and their roots down below.
\v 10 And I was the one who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
\q2 and made you walk forty years in the wilderness,
\q1 to inherit the land of the Amorites.
\q2 \v 11 I put forward some of your sons as preachers,\f + \fq preachers \fl Lit. \fqa prophets.\f*
\q1 and some of your young men as Nazirites.
\q2 'Isn't that true, children of Israel?' says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 12 But you made the Nazirites get drunk on wine,
\q2 and you told the preachers, “Don't rock the boat!”\f + \fl Lit. \fqa "Do not prophesy!"\f*
\v 13 And now I'm the one who'll load you down till you groan,
\q2 like a cart wheel groans, loaded with sheaves.
\v 14 Then runners will run out of speed,
\q2 and strong men will not have energy left.
\q1 And soldiers will not save themselves,
\q2 \v 15 and marksmen won't hold their position.
\q1 And agile runners will not get away,
\q2 and riders on horseback won't save themselves.
\v 16 And the most courageous of soldiers
\q2 will throw down their arms and run away then,”\f + \fq throw down their arms and run away \fl Lit. \fqa run away naked.\f* says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\c 3
\v 1 Listen to this problem,
\q2 that the \nd Lord\nd* has with you, people of Israel,
\q1 with the whole family
\q2 that I brought out of the land of Egypt:
\v 2 “You are the only ones I've had a relationship with
\q2 out of all the families on the earth.
\q1 That's why I'm holding you accountable
\q2 for all of your shortcomings."
\v 3 Are two people going to walk together
\q2 unless they recognize each other?
\v 4 Does a lion roar in the forest
\q2 unless it is over a carcass?
\q1 Does a leopard howl in its den
\q2 if it hasn't brought home a kill?
\v 5 Will a net bring down a songbird
\q2 if it hasn't gotten tangled up in it?
\q1 Will a snare spring up from the ground
\q2 unless it has captured game?
\v 6 When an alarm is trumpeted in a city,
\q2 won't everyone be agitated?
\q1 When disaster takes place in a city,
\q2 wasn't it brought on by the \nd Lord\nd*?
\v 7 Because His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* won't do a thing
\rem In the US "Your Honor" is the proper form of address for a magistrate. Everyone else is "mister," "sir," or nothing.
\rem Not sure of the best Continental equivalent. Your Excellency? My Lord Yahweh?
\q2 before he lets the preachers who serve him in on the plan.
\v 8 A lion has roared. Will anyone not be afraid?
\q2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken. Will anyone not speak out?
\v 9 Make an announcement from the high buildings of Ashdod,
\q2 and from the high buildings in the land of Egypt.
\q1 And say, "Assemble on the hills around Samaria,
\q2 and look down on the great uproar inside,
\q1 the acts of oppression done there."
\q2 \v 10 "It's that they have no conscience,
\q1 no sense of responsibility,"
\q2 explains the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 "They are stockpiling stolen goods
\q2 and loot in their high buildings."
\b
\v 11 "So, then," says His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 An enemy will come and surround the land,
\q1 that will bring down your fortifications,
\q2 and your high buildings will be looted."
\v 12 This is what the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\q2 “Just as a shepherd recovers, from a lion's meal,
\q1 a couple of shanks or a piece of an ear,
\q2 so the descendants of Israel living in Samaria will be escape ---
\q1 with a piece of a bed-frame,
\q2 with the damask cover of a couch!"
\v 13 "Hear and testify against the family of Jacob,"
\q2 says His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of many armies.
\v 14 "For when that I hold Israel accountable for their crimes,
\q2 I will also hold the altars of Beit El accountable.
\q1 And the horns of the altar will be chopped off,
\q2 and they will fall down on the ground.
\v 15 And I will get rid of the winter houses,
\q2 not only the summer houses,
\q1 and the ivory mansions will be no more.
\q2 And many homes will be torn down," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\c 4
\v 1 Listen to this, Bashan heifers.
\q2 You, there, on Samaria Hill.
\q1 Shouldering off the weak, scattering the needy,
\q2 calling to your husbands, “Bring out the drinks!”
\v 2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has sworn by his holiness:
\q2 "A time is coming for all of you
\q1 when you will be led along with hooks,
\q2 and chained to the one behind with fishhooks.
\v 3 You will go out in a line through the breaks in the wall,
\q2 and they will throw you out on the worm-palace," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 4 "Go to Beit El with your indiscretions.
\q2 At Gilgal, heap your scandals high;
\q1 And bring your sacrifices at first light.
\q2 Save your tithes till the third day!
\v 5 Then burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering,
\q2 and announce your free-will offerings for everyone to hear.
\q1 For that's what you love to do, you descendants of Israel!"
\q2 says His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 6 "I was the one, though, that gave you
\q2 squeaky-clean teeth in all your cities,
\q1 and food insecurity in all your high buildings.
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 7 "I was also the one who kept it from raining on you
\q2 with three months left before harvest.
\q1 And I let it rain on one city
\q2 At the same time as I did not let it rain on another.
\q1 Yet another region got some rain,
\q2 but a region that got no rain dried out.
\v 8 Then two or three cities
\q2 ranged as far as another city
\q1 for drinking water, and still they did not have enough.
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 9 "I plagued you with blight and mildew,
\q2 all through your gardens and vineyards.
\q1 Grasshoppers ate your fig and your olive trees,
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 10 "I spread epidemics among you
\q2 from the trade route to Egypt.
\q1 I had your young men killed with the sword,
\q2 your horses raided away.
\q1 And I filled the air from the fires of your camps and made you breathe it,
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 11 "I brought disasters on you, acts of God.
\q2 Left like Sodom, and like Gomorrah.
\q1 And you were like a half-burnt stick,
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 12 "So, then, here is what I will do to you, Israel,
\q2 It's at your heels. This is what I will do to you.
\q1 Get ready to meet your God, Israel!"
\q2 \v 13 Don’t you realize? The shaper of the hills, and the sender of the wind
\q1 yes, who explains to man what he is,
\q2 the maker of dawn and dusk,
\q1 and the one striding across the heights of the world ---
\q2 His name is the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies!
\b
\c 5
\v 1 Listen to this problem,
\q2 that I need to take up with you.
\q1 It’s a sad song, family of Israel.
\q2 \v 2 “She has fallen, and she can’t get up. Miss Israel has.
\q1 Thrown down on her own ground,
\q2 with no one to help her to her feet.”
\v 3 Because this is what His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\q2 "A city that fielded a thousand has a hundred left,
\q1 and the one that fielded a hundred
\q2 has only ten for the House of Israel."
\v 4 Because here is what the \nd Lord\nd* says to the family of Israel:
\q2 "Learn from me and live.
\v 5 But don't start looking to Beit El,
\q2 and do not go to Gilgal.
\q1 And do not travel to Beersheba.
\q2 Because Gilgal is doomed to deportation,
\q1 and Beit El will become a ghost town."\f + \fq will become a ghost town. \fl Lit. \fqa will be (known as) Aven.\ft Beit El was destroyed without a trace. It is possible that Aven, "empty desire," was a nearby village.\f*
\q2 \v 6 Learn from the \nd Lord\nd* and live,
\q1 or he will rage like fire through the household of Joseph,
\q2 that burns, with no one to fight it, around Beit El.
\v 7 Where you’ve plowed under good judgment and grown [cth:wormwood|us:sagebrush],
\q2 and put a stop to right practices with bad laws.
\v 8 The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,
\q2 who brings dawn just when it's darkest,
\q1 and turns the daylight back into nighttime,
\q2 who summons the ocean’s waters,
\q1 and pours them out over dry land,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.
\v 9 Who makes disaster ambush the mighty,
\q2 sends disaster as far as their hideout.
\v 10 Oh, you who hate anyone correcting you in public,
\q2 and avoid anyone who speaks frankly,
\v 11 because you've marginalized the weak,
\q2 and demanded a share of their crops!
\q1 Well, you have built tiled houses,
\q2 but you will not call them home.
\q1 You have planted lush vineyards,
\q2 But you will not drink their wine.
\v 12 Oh, I know your long list of [cth:licence|us:license],
\q2 your staggering count of sins!
\q1 You adversaries of the innocent!
\q2 Your hands out for hush money,
\q1 While you drive away the needy downtown\f + \fq downtown \fl Lit. \fqa in the gates.\f*!
\q2 \v 13 That's why a person with any sense
\q1 will keep their mouth shut at a time like this.
\q2 These are troubled times.
\v 14 So work toward good, and stay out of trouble,
\q2 You want to live. So be it!
\q1 Yes, the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies,
\q2 be with you, as you have said.
\v 15 Hate trouble, and love good,
\q2 and make justice a fixture downtown.
\q1 Who knows? Maybe the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies,
\q2 will be sympathetic to what’s left of Joseph.
\b
\v 16 So this is what the \nd Lord\nd* says,
\q2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor], the God of Armies.
\q1 "There will be mourning on every boulevard,
\q2 and in every street they’ll cry, 'No, no!'
\q1 They’ll call in the gravedigger to the burial,
\q2 and the funeral directors for the memorial,
\v 17 There’ll be a funeral in every farmyard,
\q2 when I come through to deal with you," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 18 "Beware, you that are wishing for the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*!
\q2 What business of yours is the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q1 It's darkness, and not light.
\q2 \v 19 It's like when a person runs away from a lion,
\q1 and a bear meets them,
\q2 Or they go in the house, and lean a hand on the wall,
\q1 and a snake bites them.
\q2 \v 20 Won’t it be dark on the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*, and not bright?
\q1 Amd be black, without a ray of light?
\q2 \v 21 I hate, I'm disgusted by your holidays.
\q1 And I do not want to smell your barbecues.
\q2 \v 22 No, if you offer burnt offerings,
\q1 and grain offerings, I won’t enjoy them.
\q2 I won’t give your marbled meat a second look.
\v 23 Get the noise of your songs away from me.
\q2 I am through listening to the plunking of your strings.
\v 24 Just let fairness roll in like ocean waves,
\q2 and ethics like a year-round stream.
\v 25 Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings
\q2 in the wilderness forty years, family of Israel?
\v 26 No, you carried the shelters of your kings,
\q2 and the standard of your images,
\q1 the star of your gods, that you made for yourselves.
\q2 \v 27 And I will deport you beyond Damascus."
\q1 That is what the \nd Lord\nd* has said,
\q2 whose name is the God of Armies.
\b
\v 6
\v 1 Watch out, you who are at your ease in Zion,
\q2 and self-assured in Samaria Hill!
\q1 You're driven men, an international elite,
\q2 And the family of Israel comes to you.
\v 2 Travel to Calneh and see,
\q2 and go from there to Greater Hamath.
\q1 Then out to Philistine Gath. Are your kingdoms better than theirs?
\q2 Or is the area inside your borders bigger?
\v 3 Are you holding off times of hardship?
\q2 And how? At the price of harsh tyranny?
\v 4 You are lying on ivory beds,
\q2 and relaxing on your couches,
\q1 and eating milk-fed lamb and penned veal.
\q2 \v 5 You improvise to the sound of the \tr nevel\tr*\f + \fr 6.5 \fq \tr nevel\tr* \ft A resonating stringed instrument that is an ancestor of the guitar.\f*,
\q1 inventing new musical instruments like David.
\q2 \v 6 You drink wine by the bowlful,
\q1 and put on lotions of virgin oil,\f + \fq virgin oil \ft Oil from Tekoa was traditionally preferred for Temple use, because of its quality.\f*
\q2 but you are not at all concerned about the decline of Joseph.
\v 7 So now you'll be the first in line to be deported,
\q2 and the cheers of the party-goers will fade away.
\v 8 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has sworn by himself.
\q2 The \nd Lord\nd*,  the God of Armies, announces,
\q1 "I want nothing to do with the Rise of Jacob!\f + \fq Rise of Jacob \fl Traditionally, \fqa Pride of Jacob.\f*
\q2 And I hate their high buildings.
\q1 So I will write off\f + \fr 6.8 \fq write off \ft The Hebrew word means both \fqa write off \ft and \fqa seal up.\f* cities and everyone in them."
\q2 \v 9 For example, if there are ten men
\q1 left in one household, they'll all die.
\q2 \v 10 And there will be someone taking the corpse
\q1 of a relative outside to burn it.
\q2 And he will ask someone he meets in an alley,
\q1 “Is anyone left?”
\q2 And he will answer, “Not a one,” and then, “Hush!
\q1 We mustn’t be heard speaking the name of the \nd Lord\nd*!”
\q2 \v 11 Because, you see, the \nd Lord\nd* will give the order
\q1 to shatter the great house to bits,
\q2 and to split the small house into pieces.
\v 12 Can horses run over steep rocks?
\q2 Can they be plowed with oxen?
\q1 Because you’ve turned right judgment over to opium,
\q2 and the fruit of right practice to [cth:wormwood|us:sagebrush].
\v 13 You who celebrate over Lo Debar, “Nothing There,”
\q2 and say, “Look! We were strong enough to take Karnaim, ‘Horns,’ for ourselves.”
\v 14 "I'll show you, family of Israel. I’m preparing" ---
\q2 declares the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies --- "an enemy nation.
\q1 And they will harass you from Hamath Gap\f + \fl Traditionally: \fqa the Entrance of Hamath. \ft Homs Gap, site of the \em Krak des Chevaliers\em* castle, is known as "the gateway to Syria."\f*
\q2 to the Wadi Arabah."
\c 7
\v 1 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* showed me this.
\q2 I looked, and he was bringing locusts,
\q1 when the grass from the spring rains sprouted.
\q2 Now, this was the growth flush after the King’s Cutting.
\v 2 And when they were about
\q2 to finish off the vegetation of the land,
\q1 Then I said, Your [cth:Honour|us:Honor], \nd Lord\nd*! Please, stop!
\q2 How can Jacob survive? He is so small!
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* was moved by the thought.
\q2 “That will not happen,” the \nd Lord\nd* said.
\b
\v 4 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* showed me this.
\q2 I saw that he was calling for fire to come up ---
\q1 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* was. And it burned deep underground,
\q2 and it had begun to devour the farmland.
\v 5 Then I said, Your [cth:Honour|us:Honor], \nd Lord\nd*! Stop, please!,
\q2 How can Jacob survive? He is so small!'
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* was moved by the thought.
\q2 “That will not happen, either,” His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* said.
\b
\v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* showed me this.
\q2 I saw that the \nd Lord\nd* was standing
\q1 beside a wall under construction,\f + \fr 5.12 \fq wall under construction \fl Or \fqa masonry wall. \fl Lit. \fqa wall for a plumbline.\f*
\q2 and he had a plumbline in his hand.
\v 8 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\q2 "What do you see, Amos?"
\q1 And I answered, “A plumbline.”
\q2 Then His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* said,
\q1 “It’s because I’m going to hold a plumbline
\q2 up against my people Israel,
\q1 I am not going to spare them any more.
\q2 \v 9 And Ithaac’s\f + \fr 7.9 \ft Amos misspells "Isaac," creating a play on words that makes it sound like he is calling the patriarch a "playboy" instead of "the son of laughter."\f* hilltop shrines will be turned into ruins.
\q1 The temples of Israel will be desolate,
\q2 and I will attack the House of Jeroboam with the sword.”
\b
\v 10 Then Amaziah the priest of Beit El
\q2 sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel that said,
\q1 “Amos has formed a conspiracy against you among the House of Israel.
\q2 The country is not secure while he is allowed to speak.
\v 11 Because Amos has said that ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
\q2 and Israel is going to be deported away from their own soil.'”
\b
\v 12 Then Amaziah said to Amos, "You holy man!\f + \fq holy man \fl Lit. \fqa seer. \fl cf. \ft 1 Samuel 9.9. Amaziah insults Amos by using the archaic term for a prophet.\f* Go, run back home to Judah!
\q2 and ‘eat bread’\f + \fq eat bread \ft A mocking reference to the story in 1 Kings 13.9\f* there, and do your preaching there!
\v 13 But you are never to speak out at Beit El again.
\q2 Because this is the national cathedral, and the seat of royal authority."
\v 14 Then Amos answered Amaziah, and said,
\q2 “I am not a preacher. I am not a member of any preacher's school.\f + \fl Lit. \fqa not a prophet's apprentice (2 Kings 2.3).\f*
\q1 But I was a cowhand, and I scored sycomore figs for ripening.
\q2 \v 15 Then the \nd Lord\nd* took me from the cattle trail,
\q1 and the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, ‘Go, and speak out to my people Israel.’
\q2 \v 16 So, now, listen to the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 You're saying, ‘Don't speak out against Israel,
\q2 or criticize the House of Ithaac.’
\v 17  Well, that's why the \nd Lord\nd* says this:
\q2 'Your wife is going to end up as a prostitute in the big city.
\q1 Your sons and your daughters are going to fall by the sword.
\q2 Your farm is going to be surveyed and subdivided.
\q1 And you yourself are going to die where the land is unclean,
\q2 and Israel is going to be deported away from their own soil.'”
\b
\c 8
\v 1 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* showed me something.
\q2 It was a harvesting bin.\f + \fl Others \fqa a basket of summer fruit. \ft The word \fqa fruit \ft is not part of the text. \f*
\v 2 Then he said, 'What do you see, Amos?'
\q2 And I said, 'It's a harvest bin.'
\q1 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, “The end of harvest is on my people Israel.
\q2 I am not going to spare them any more.
\v 3 Oh, they are going to wail their songs in the great hall then,"
\q2 declares His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 “Carcasses will be piled everywhere.
\q2 ‘Get them out of here! Hush!’”
\b
\v 4 Listen to this, you that market to the needy,
\q2 and try to put family farmers out of work.
\v 5 You’re saying,
\q2 ‘When will the first of the month be over,
\q1 So that we can retail in earnest?”
\q2 And the Sabbath, so we can portion out product?
\q1 Making the \tr ephah\tr* smaller and smaller, and the \tr shekel\tr* weigh more and more,
\q2 And giving false value with rigged scales.
\v 6 While you buy off the weak with a wage,
\q2 and the poor for the proverbial pair of shoes.
\q1 While you package the waste in with the goods!’”
\q2 \v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* swears, “By the Rise of Jacob!
\q1 See if I ever forget all they have done!”
\q2 \v 8 Isn’t that why the earth is in uproar,
\q1 And all its population is in despair?
\q2 That's why the sea level rises like a spring flood,\f + \fq like a spring flood \fl Others \fqa like the Nile. \ft The word \tr 'or\tr*, used only here, is probably a common noun related to \tr Y'or\tr*, "Nile."\f*
\q1 And overflows, and spreads out,
\q2 And finds a new shore,\f + \fq finds a new shore \fl Traditionally emended as \fqa subsides \ft to match 9.5e. The emendation, from a common water-word to a less common one, seems unnecessary. \f* like the Nile in Egypt.
\b
\v 9 "And it will also happen at that time,"
\q2 declares His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "That I will bring in the sun at noon
\q2 And darken the land on a clear day.
\v 10 And I will turn your holidays into mourning,
\q2 And all your songs into wailing.
\q1 I will have everyone wearing black,
\q2 And every head shaved.
\q1 I will make it like the mourning for an only child,
\q2 And what follows like a day for embalming.\f + \fq a day for embalming \fl Traditionally \fqa a bitter day. \ft Repointing gives \tr yom mor\tr*, "a day for myrrh" instead of \tr mar\tr*, "a bitter day."\f*
\v 11 "You see, times are coming,"
\q2 declares His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "When I will send a famine on the land.
\q2 Not a food famine or a water shortage,
\q1 But one for hearing the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 \v 12 Then they will flit from sea to sea,
\q1 And from the north to the sunrise, they will flog themselves
\q2 in search of the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, but they won't find it.
\v 13 In that day the beautiful girls
\q2 And the eligible young men are going to faint from thirst,
\v 14 The ones who swear by the Guilt Sacrifice of Samaria,
\q2 and say, 'Your God lives, Dan!’
\q1 And, ‘Long live the Way of Beersheba!'
\q2 Yes, they will fall, and not get up again."
\b
\c 9
\v 1 I saw the \nd Lord\nd* standing next to the altar,
\q2 and he said, “Hit the capital, and make the thresholds shake!
\q1 Yes, break them all off at the top!
\q2 And I’ll kill the ones left with the sword.
\q1 Not a one will bolt and get away.
\q2 And none of the stragglers will escape.
\v 2 If they burrow down to Sheol,
\q2 I’ll reach in and pull them out.
\q1 And if they soar up into the sky,
\q2 I will bring them right down to ground.
\v 3 If they hide out on the top of Carmel,
\q2 I’ll come in quietly and round them up there.
\q1 And if they hide where I can't see them on the bottom of the ocean,
\q2 I’ll just send in a deep-sea eel to bite them.
\v 4 And if they try to return home in spite of their enemies,
\q2 I will send to have them killed with the sword.
\q1 I will keep my eye on them, all right.
\q2 I mean that in a bad way, not in a good way."
\v 5 And His [cth:Honour|us:Honor], the \nd Lord\nd* of Armies,
\q2 who touches the earth and it melts,
\q1 and all of its population panics,
\q2 and the sea level rises like a river in flood,
\q1 and crests, like the Nile in Egypt,
\q2 \v 6 who builds up water towers in the sky,
\q1 and has set up its reservoirs on earth,
\q2 who summons the waters of the ocean,
\q1 and pours them out on dry land;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.
\v 7 “Aren’t you just like the people of the Cushites to me,
\q2 people of Israel?” says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 “Didn’t I bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt?
\q2 And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
\v 8 See, now. His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has his eye on this crooked country,
\q2 And he would have wiped you off the face of the earth,
\q1 if it wasn’t that he will never make a full end
\q2 Of the family of Jacob," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 9 "Because, you see, I am going to give the order,
\q2 and the family of Israel will be sifted among all the nations,
\q1 like sifting through a grain sieve.
\q2 And not one pebble will fall to the ground.
\v 10 Through the sword all the evildoers among my people will die.
\q2 The ones who say, “Trouble won’t touch us. It’s not coming our way.”
\v 11 At that time I will put up again
\q2 David’s shelter that has fallen down.
\q1 And I will patch the holes in the the wall,
\q2 and I'll rebuild what’s been torn apart,
\q1 and I will build it again the way it was a long time ago.
\q2 \v 12 So they may take possession of what’s left of Edom,
\q1 and all the nations that have had my name called over them,”
\q2 declares the \nd Lord\nd*, who does all this.
\b
\v 13 "A time is coming, you see,"
\q2 declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "when the plowman will be interrupted\f + \fq will be interrupted \fl Others \fqa will overtake. \fl Lit. \fqa will meet.\f* by the reaper,
\q2 and the grape treader by the one bringing out the seed.
\q1 And the mountains will foam over with fresh wine,
\q2 and all of the hills will re-soften.
\v 14 And I will bring back the returnees of my people Israel,
\q2 and they will rebuild the ruined cities and live there,
\q1 and plant vineyards and drink their wine,
\q2 and plant orchards and eat their fruit.
\v 15 And I will plant them on their land,
\q2 and they will never again be uprooted from their own soil,
\q1 which I gave to them,"
\q2 says the \nd Lord\nd* your God.
