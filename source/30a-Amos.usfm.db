\h Amos
\mt2 The Sermons of
\mt1 Amos

\c 1
\v 1
\s The Superscription and Text of the Book

\p The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, and in the reign of Jeroboam the son of King Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
\q
\v 2 Amos said:
\q Whenever the \nd Lord\nd* roars from Zion,
\q and utters his voice from Jerusalem,
\q the pastures of the shepherds dry up,
\q and the top of Carmel becomes arid.

\s The Judgment About to Overtake Israel's Guilty Neighbors
\q
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Damascus' three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.
\b
\q
\v 4 Therefore I will send fire on Hazael's house,
\q and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad,
\q
\v 5 and I will break open the gate of Damascus,
\q and I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven,
\q and the sceptered ruler of Beth-Eden;
\q the people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Gaza's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They carried away captive a whole nation,
\q sold them as slaves to Edom.
\b
\q
\v 7 Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza,
\q and it shall devour her palaces.
\q
\v 8 And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod,
\q and the sceptered ruler of Askelon.
\q I will turn my hand against Ekron,
\q and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,
\q the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\b
\q
\v 9 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Tyre's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom,
\q and did not remember the brotherly covenant.
\b
\q
\v 10 So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre.
\q It will devour her palaces.
\b
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Edom's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They pursued their relatives with the sword,
\q stilled their pity,
\q cherished their anger continually,
\q retained their fury forever.
\b
\q
\v 12 So I will send a fire into Teman.
\q It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah.
\b
\q
\v 13 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Ammonites' three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,
\q in their lust for land.
\b
\q
\v 14 So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah.
\q It will destroy her palaces,
\q with a war-cry in the day of battle,
\q with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
\q
\v 15 Their king will go into exile,
\q he and his nobles together,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\c 2
\v 1 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Moab's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom,
\q
\v 2 to desecrate the dead.
\b
\q So I will send a fire into Moab.
\q It will devour the palaces of Kirioth,
\q with a war-cry,
\q with the sound of trumpets.
\q
\v 3 I will kill the ruler,
\q all his nobles I will slay with him,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Judah's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They have rejected the law of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q and have not kept his statutes,
\q but their false gods their ancestors followed,
\q have led them astray.
\b
\q
\v 5 So I will send a fire on Judah.
\q It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

\s The Judgment Awaiting Thrice Guilty Israel
\q
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q For Israel's three crimes –
\q no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
\q They sell the righteous for money,
\q the needy for a pair of shoes.
\q
\v 7 They trample on the head of the poor,
\q push the humble out of the way.
\q Father and son go to the same temple girl,
\q and so profane my holy name.
\q
\v 8 They stretch themselves on garments taken in pledges beside every altar,
\q and they drink the wine of those who have been fined in the house of their God.
\b
\q
\v 9 It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake,
\q whose height was like that of the cedars,
\q as strong as oaks.
\q I destroyed their fruit from above and their roots from below.
\b
\q
\v 10 It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
\q and led you forty years in the wilderness,
\q and brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites.
\b
\q
\v 11 I raised up some of your sons to be prophets
\q and some of your youths to be Nazirites.
\q Is not this indeed so, Israelites?
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 12 But you made the Nazirites drink wine
\q and banned the prophets from prophesying.
\b
\q
\v 13 Listen!
\q It is I who will make you groan in your places,
\q as a wagon groans under its load of grain.
\b
\q
\v 14 Then flight will fail the swift,
\q and the strength of the strongest will be useless.
\q The warrior will not save his life,
\q
\v 15 the archer will not stand firm,
\q the swift of foot will not escape,
\q the horseman will not save his life.
\q
\v 16 The bravest of warriors
\q will flee away naked in that day,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.

\c 3
\v 1
\s The Basis of the Prophet's Arraignment of Israel
\q Hear this word
\q which the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken against you, Israelites,
\q against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt:
\q
\v 2 You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world,
\q this is why I will punish you for your crimes.
\b
\q
\v 3 Do two walk together unless they agreed to meet?
\q
\v 4 Does a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him?
\q Does a young lion cry out in his den unless he has caught something?
\q
\v 5 Does a bird swoop down into a trap if no bait is set for it?
\q Does a trap spring up from the ground if nothing sets it off?
\q
\v 6 Can a trumpet be blown in a city and the people not tremble?
\q Can disaster strike a city and the \nd Lord\nd* not have caused it?
\b
\q
\v 7 Surely the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* does nothing
\q without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets.
\q
\v 8 The lion has roared; who does not fear?
\q The Lord \nd God\nd* has spoken; who will not prophesy?

\s The Guilt and Doom of Samaria
\q
\v 9 Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod,
\q and over the palaces in the land of Egypt:
\q Gather upon the mountain of Samaria,
\q and see the violent turmoil,
\q the acts of oppression in her midst.
\q
\v 10 For they do not know how to do right.
\q They are heaping up violence and oppression in their palaces,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\v 11
\q Therefore the Lord \nd God\nd* says:
\q An enemy will surround the land,
\q he will strip your strength from you.
\q and your palaces will be looted.
\v 12
\q The \nd Lord\nd* says:
\q Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion
\q two shin-bones or a piece of an ear,
\q so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued –
\q with the corner of a couch,
\q and the damask of a divan!
\b
\v 13
\q Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,
\q says the Lord \nd God\nd*, the God of hosts.
\v 14
\q On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes,
\q I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel,
\q and the horns of the altar will be hacked off,
\q and they will fall to the ground.
\q
\v 15 I will destroy the winter houses together with the summer houses
\q and the houses of ivory will perish.
\q Many great houses will be swept away,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\c 4
\v 1 Listen to this message, women of Sameria,
\q you well-fed cows of Bashan,
\q who oppress the poor and crush the needy,
\q who say to your husbands, “Bring us another drink!”
\b
\q
\v 2 The Lord \nd God\nd* has sworn by his holiness:
\q The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets,
\q your children carried away in fish-baskets,
\q
\v 3 and through the breaches in the city wall you will go,
\q thrown out on the garbage dump,
\q says the \nd Lord\nd*.

\s Israel's Failure to Understand the Lord's Judgments
*********
\q
\v 4 Come to Bethel and transgress,
\q At Gilgald increase your transgression;
\q And bring in the morning your sacrifices,
\q On the third day your tithes!
\b
\q
\v 5 And burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering,
\q And proclaim aloud the voluntary offerings,
\q For you love to do so, O Israelites!
\q It is the oracle of the Lord the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 6 But it was also I who gave to you
\q Empty stomachs in all your cities,
\q And lack of bread in all your palaces,
\q Yet ye have not returned to me, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 7 I also it was who withheld from you the rain,
\q And I sent rain upon one city,
\q While upon another I did not let it rain,
\q
\v 8 Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 9 I smote you with blight and mildew,
\q I laid waste your gardens and vineyards,
\q Your fig and your olive trees the young locust devoured;
\q Yet you did not return to me, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 10 I sent among you a pestilence by the way of Egypt,
\q I slew your youths with the sword, taking captive your horses,
\q And I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils;
\q Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 11 I wrought a destruction among you,
\q As God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
\q And ye were as a brand plucked from the burning;
\q Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 12 Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel,
\q Because I am about to do this to thee,
\q Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
\b
\q
\v 13 For behold it is he who formeth the mountains,
\q And createth the wind,
\q And declareth to man what is his thought;
\q He maketh dawn and darkness,
\q And treadeth upon the heights of the earth,
\q the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of hosts, is his name.

\c 5
\v 1
\s Certain Destruction Awaiting Israel Unless She Seeks the Lord
\q Hear the word which I take up against you, even a dirge, O house of Israel:
\q
\v 2 Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel!
\q Hurled down upon her own soil she lies, with none to raise her!
\b
\q
\v 3 For thus saith the Lord the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q The city that taketh the field with a thousand hath but a hundred left,
\q And the one that taketh the field with a hundred bath but ten left.
\q
\v 4 For thus saith the \nd Lord\nd* to the house of Israel:
\q Seek me and live,
\q
\v 5 But seek not Bethel,
\q And Gilgal do not enter,
\q To Beersheba go not over;
\q For Gilgal shall taste the gall of exile,
\q And Bethel shall go to perdition.
\b
\q
\v 6 Seek the \nd Lord\nd* and live,
\q Lest he cast fire on the house of Joseph,
\q And it devour and there be none to quench it for Bethel.
\b
\q
\v 8 He it is who made the Pleades and Orions
\q Who turneth deep gloom into morning,
\q And darkeneth day again into night,
\q Who calleth the waters of the sea,
\q And poureth them out on the face of the earth,
\q
\v 9 Who causeth destruction to burst over the strong,
\q And bringeth devastation upon the fortress,
\q the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.

\s A Solemn Warning to the Corrupt Judges
\q
\v 7 Alas, for those who turn judgment to wormwood,
\q And east righteousness to the ground,
\q Who hate him that reproves in the gate,
\q And abhor one that speaks uprightly!
\b
\q
\v 11 Therefore, because ye trample upon the weak,
\q And take front him exactions of grain,
\q Houses of hewn stone have ye built,
\q But ye shall not dwell in them,
\q Charming vineyards have ye planted,
\q But ye shall not drink their wine.
\b
\q
\v 12 Surely I know how many are your transgressions,
\q And how great are your sins!
\q Ye persecutors of the righteous, takers of bribes!
\q Yea, the needy in the gated they thrust aside.
\b
\q
\v 13 Therefore since the prudent man at such a time keeps silent,
\q It is surely an evil time.
\q
\v 14 Seek good and not evil,
\q That ye may live;
\q That this the \nd Lord\nd*, God of hosts,
\q May be with you, as ye have said.
\b
\q
\v 15 Hate evil and love good,
\q And establish justice in the gate;
\q Perhaps the \nd Lord\nd* will be gracious,
\q The God of hosts, to a remnant of Joseph.
\b
\q
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the \nd Lord\nd* thee God of hosts:
\q In all squares there shall be wailing,
\q And in every street they shall say, "Alas! Alas!"
\q And they shall summon the husbandman to mourning,
\q And to wailing those skilled in lamentation,
\q
\v 17 Yea, in all vineyards there shall be wailing,
\q When I pass through the midst of thee, saith the \nd Lord\nd*.

\s Captivity Awaiting Corrupt Israel
\q
\v 18 Alas, for those who long for the day of the \nd Lord\nd*!
\q What have you to do with the day of the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q It is darkness, and not light.
\q
\v 19 It is as when one flees from a lion,
\q And a bear falls upon him,
\q Or goes into the house and leans his hand upon the wall,
\q And a serpent bites him.
\q
\v 20 Shall not the \nd Lord\nd*'s day be darkness and not light,
\q Yea, murky darkness without a ray of light in it?
\q
\v 21 I hate, I despise your feasts,
\q And I will not smell the savor of your festivals,
\q
\v 22 And with your cereal-offerings I will not be pleased,
\q And the peace-offerings of your fatlings I will not regard with favor.
\q
\v 23 Banish from me the noise of your songs,
\q For to the melody of your lyres I will not listen.
\q
\v 24 But let justice roll on as a flood of waters,
\q And righteousness like an unfailing stream.
\b
\q
\v 25 Was it only sacrifices and cereal-offerings ye brought me
\q In the wilderness during forty years, O house of Israel?
\q
\v 26 But now ye shall lift up the shrine of your king,
\q And the image of your God which you have made for yourselves,
\q
\v 27 And I will carry you away into exile beyond Damascus,
\q Saith the \nd Lord\nd* the God of hosts.
\b
\q
\c 6
\v 1 Alas for those who are careless in Zion,
\q And overconfident on the mountain of Samaria!
\q Men of mark of the first of the nations,
\q To whom the house of Israel resort!
\q
\v 2 Pass over to Calneh and see,
\q And go from there to Hamath the great,
\q Then go down to Gath of the Philistines –
\q Are they better than these kingdoms,
\q Or is your territory larger than their territory?
\q
\v 3 They who would postpone the day of calamity,
\q And yet have instituted a rule of violence.
\q
\v 4 They who lie on ivory couches,
\q And sprawl upon their divans,
\q And eat lambs from the flock,
\q And calves from out the stall;
\q
\v 5 They drawl to the sound of the lyre,
\q Like David, they devise for themselves instruments of song.
\q
\v 6 They drink bowlfuls of wine,
\q And anoint themselves with the finest of oil,
\q But they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
\b
\q
\v 7 Therefore now they must go into exile at the head of the captives,
\q And hushed shall be the revelry of the sprawlers,
\q
\v 8 It is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of hosts.
\q the \nd Lord\nd* hath sworn by himself:
\q I abhor the pride of Jacob,
\q And his palaces I hate,
\q Therefore I will deliver up the city and all that is in it,
\q
\v 11 And one shall smite the great house into atoms,
\q And the small house into fragments.
\b
\q
\v 12 Do horses run upon crags?
\q Does one plow the sea with oxen?
\q That you turn justice into poison,
\q And, the fruit of righteousness into wormwood?
\q
\v 13 Ye who rejoice in that which is not,
\q Who say, 'Have we not by our own strength taken horns for ourselves.
\q
\v 14 Verily, I am now raising up against you,
\q O house of Israel, a nation;
\q And they shall oppress you,
\q From the entrance of Hamath
\q Even to the brook of the Arabah,
\q Is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of hosts.

\s Symbolic Pictures of the Impending Judgment
\q Thus the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* showed me,
\q And behold, he was forming locusts,
\q When the late spring grass began to come up.
\q
\v 2 And when they were making an end
\q Of devouring the vegetation of the land,
\q I said, O Lord the \nd Lord\nd*, forgive, I pray,
\q How can Jacob stand, for he is small?
\q
\v 3 the \nd Lord\nd* relented concerning this;
\q It shall not be, said the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 4 Thus the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* showed me,
\q And behold, he was giving command to execute judgment,
\q By fire – the Lord the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q And it devoured the great deep,
\q And had begun to devour the tilled land;
\q
\v 5 Then I said, 0 Lord the \nd Lord\nd* cease, I pray,
\q How can Jacob stand for he is small? '
\q
\v 6 the \nd Lord\nd* relented concerning this;
\q Neither shall this be, said the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 7 Thus the Lord showed me,
\q And behold the Lord was standing
\q Beside a wall, with a plumb-line in his hand.
\q
\v 8 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\q What dost thou see, Amos?
\q And I answered, A plumb-line,
\q Then the Lord said, Behold I am setting a plumb-line
\q In the midst of my people Israel,
\q I will not again pass by them any more.
\q
\v 9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
\q The sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste,
\q And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

\s Amaziah's Accusation and Amos's Reply

\p
\v 10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words."
\v 11 For thus has Amos said, `Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.'
\rem Titleless Section Break
\b
\p
\v 12 Also Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go flee away to the land of Judah, and there eat bread and there prophesy;
\v 13 but you shall no longer prophesy at Bethel; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the royal residence.
\rem Titleless Section Break
\b
\p
\v 14 Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, nor a son of a prophet; but I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamores;
\v 15 but the \nd Lord\nd* took me from following the flock, and the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, Go, prophesy against my people Israel.
\rem Titleless Section Break
\b
\p
\v 16 Now therefore hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*: Thou sayest, "Thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, nor preach against the house of Isaac."
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the \nd Lord\nd*: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die upon an unclean soil, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.

\s The Symbolic Picture of Israel's Approaching End
\q Thus the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* showed me,
\q And behold, a basket of summer fruit.
\q
\v 2 Then he said, 'What dost thou see, Amos?'
\q And I said, 'A basket of summer fruit.'
\q And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
'The end has come to my people Israel,
\q I will not again pass them by.'
\b
\q
\v 4 Hear this, you who trample upon the needy,
\q And oppress the poor of the earth, saying,
\q
\v 5 When shall the new moon pass that we may sell grain,
\q And the sabbath that we may open the corn –
\q Making smaller the measure and enlarging the weight,
\q And perverting the false balances –
\q
\v 6 And that we may sell the refuse of the corn!
\b
\q
\v 7 the \nd Lord\nd* bath sworn by the pride of Jacob,
\q Never shall I forget all their deeds!
\q
\v 8 For this shall not the land tremble,
\q And all her inhabitants mourn?
\q Shall not the whole of it rise like the Nile,
\q And sink like the Nile of Egypt?
\b
\q
\v 9 And it shall come to pass in that day,
\q It is the oracle of the Lord the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q That I will make the sun set at noon
\q And darken the earth in broad day,
\q And the singing-women of the palace shall wail,
\q It is the oracle of the Lord the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q A multitude of carcasses! In every place they are cast!
\b
\q
\v 10 And I will turn your festivals into mourning,
\q And all your songs into dirges,
\q I will bring upon all loins sackcloth,
\q And upon every head baldness,
\q I will make it like the mourning for an only son,
\q And the end of it like a bitter day.
\b
\q
\v 11 And I will send hunger in the land,
\q Not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water,
\q But for hearing the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 12 Then shall they wander from sea to sea,
\q From the north to the rising of the sun shall they run to and fro,
\q To seek the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, but they shall not find it.
\b
\q
\v 13 In that day shall faint
\q The fairest maidens and the youths,
\q
\v 14 Who swear by the guilts of Samaria,
\q And say, 'As liveth thy God, O Dan!
\q And as liveth thy patron, O Beersheba!'
\q And they shall fall, no more to rise!

\s The Portrayal of the Final Destruction of the Nation
\q I saw the Lord standing by the altar;
\q And he said, Smite the capitals that the thresholds may shake,
\q Yea, break them off upon the head of all of them,
\q And the rest of them I will slay with the sword,
\q Not one of them shall escape,
\q Nor shall a refugee be delivered from among them.
\b
\q
\v 2 If they dig through to Sheol,
\q Thence will my hand take them;
\q And if they climb up to heaven,
\q Thence will I bring them down;
\q
\v 3 And if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
\q Thence will I search them out and take them.
\b
\q And if they hide out of my sight at the bottom of the sea,
\q Thence will I command the sea-serpent to bite them;
\q
\v 4 And if they go-into captivity before their enemies,
\q Thence will I command the sword to slay them,
\q And I will keep my eye on them,
\q For evil and not for good.
\b
\q
\v 5 And it is the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q Who toucheth the earth and it melts,
\q And all who dwell in it mourn,
\q And all of it rises up like the Nile,
\q And sinks like the Nile of Egypt.
\q
\v 6 He who buildeth his chambers in the heavens,
\q And hath established his vault upon the earth;
\q He that calleth for the waters of the sea.
\q And poureth them out upon the face of the earth
\q the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.
\b
\q
\v 7 Are ye not as the Cushites to me
\q O Israel? is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt,
\q And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
\q
\v 8 Behold the eyes of the Lord the \nd Lord\nd* are upon the sinful kingdom,
\q And I will destroy it from the face of the earth.
\q Except that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob,
\q It is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\s The Glories of the Restoration
\q
\v 9 For behold I am about to give command.
\q And I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations.
\q Just as one shakes grain in a sieve;
\q But not a kernel shall fall to the ground.
\q
\v 10 By the sword shall die all the sinners of my people,
\q Who say, Disaster shall not touch or befall us.
\b
\q
\v 11 In that time I will raise up the hut of David that is fallen,
\q I will wall up its breaches and raise up its ruins,
\q And I will rebuild it as in the days of old,

\v 12 In order that they may possess the remnant of Edom,
\q And all the nations which were called by my name,
\q It is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*, who will do this.
\b
\q
\v 13 Behold the days are coming, is the oracle of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q When the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
\q And the treader of grapes him who soweth seed;
\q The mountains also shall drop sweet wine.
\q And all the hills shall melt.
\b
\q
\v 14 And I will lead back the captivity of my people Israel,
\q And they shall rebuild waste cities and inhabit them.
\q And they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine,
\q And they shall make gardens and eat their fruit,
\q
\v 15 And I will plant them upon their own soil.
\q And they shall never again be torn away from their land,
\q Which I have given them, saith the \nd Lord\nd* thy God.
